#  Understanding Fractal Animator Concepts

This document outlines key concepts within our fractal animator software, helping you grasp how it generates mesmerizing fractal animations.

## Animating the fractal

**1. `image`: The Fractal Heartbeat**

* An `image` represents a single, static fractal image generated by external fractal software. Think of it as a snapshot of intricate patterns and mesmerizing structures.

**2. `frame`: Building the Animation**

* Each `frame` in the output video is a composition of multiple `image`s, meticulously arranged over time.

**3. `loader`: Bridging the Gap**

* The `loader` acts as a bridge between your fractal software and our animator. It imports the generated `image`s, making them accessible for animation.

**4. `interpolator`: Choreographing the Zoom**

* An `interpolator` is the mastermind behind the animation's dynamic zoom effect. It's an algorithm that determines the speed and pattern of zoom changes across different `image`s.

**5. `indicator`: Zoom Level Display**

* An `indicator` is an overlay text displayed in the video that shows the current zoom level. It helps viewers understand the scale of the fractal they are observing.

**Putting it Together:**

By combining these elements, our fractal animator software transforms static fractal `image`s into captivating animated sequences. The `loader` imports the images, the `interpolator` guides their zoom, and the `indicator` provides visual feedback, all orchestrated over time.

## Units

**`scale`: Defining the Viewport**

* `scale` represents the range of values visible within the animation's viewport. It's determined by the narrowest
  side of the screen and the range displayed (e.g., -2i to 2i on a 1080p screen would have a scale of 4).

**`magnification`: Zoom Factor**

* `magnification` indicates how much the viewport is zoomed in compared to its initial state. It's a multiplier
  that increases with each zoom action.

**`zooms`: Logarithmic Zoom Level**

* `zooms` is the logarithmic representation of `magnification`. It's calculated as `log2(magnification)`, providing
  a more intuitive way to represent zoom levels.

**`time`: The Animation's Timeline**

* `time` represents the duration of each `frame` in the video. It's measured in seconds and dictates the pacing of the animation.
